## Fonts

For custom fonts or font assets from a hird-pary vendor, you can place files here.

The task itself will simply copy files from `src` to `dest` folder defined in `path-config.json`.

In `task-config.js` you can define which file formats to watch for. See `gulpfile.js/lib/task-defaults.js` for available options.
