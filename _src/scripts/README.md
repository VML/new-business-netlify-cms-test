## JS

Under the hood, JS is compiled with webpack with a heavily customized webpack file to get you up and running with little to no configuration. An API for configuring some of the most commonly accessed options are exposed, along with some other helpers for scoping to environment. Additionally, you can get full access to modify webpackConfig via the customizeWebpackConfig option.

See javascripts object in `gulpfile.js/task-config.js` for available options.
